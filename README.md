# WindowSnap.Spoon

A HammerSpoon for snapping windows to the top, bottom, left, right, etc, and mimicing hardware keys for playing/rewinding/pausing/etc. music.

This was made before https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt/wiki/The-Hammerspoon-Alternative was availalbe so I'd recommend you go down that route if you only want window snapping.

### Setup
Run setup.py to insert this into your HammerSpoon config
